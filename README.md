## Useful Outside Resources

Over the past couple of weeks, we've explored a lot of codes and functions which can seem overwhelming at times.  There are two cheatsheets that I've relied on a lot this semester, one on [Data Visualization](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) and one on [Data Wrangling](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
