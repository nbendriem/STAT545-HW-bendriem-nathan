# STAT545-hw02-Bendriem-Nathan

For this homework, I played around with the gapminder dataset and the ggplot functions.

There are several files within the hw02 folder.  The answers to HW02 files (.Rmd, .md, .html) show all of the answers to the questions, as well as the steps I took to get the answers, the code functions I relied on, and the numerous graphs I created

The R Codes for HW2 file is basically just a rough draft, trying to pinpoint down the correct code function.  I included it for my own benefit, in case I want to retrace my steps.
