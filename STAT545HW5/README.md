### Reflection

This weeks homework was pretty intensive in my opinion.  The easy part was to clean up my GitHub page and make sure every thing is in the right homework folder.  
The factor re-ordering took some time.  I relied a lot on Google searches and the class notes for this one.  There is also a great page on the STAT545 on [factors](http://stat545.com/block029_factors.html)

Once I finished that, creating the graphs was not too bad.  I experimented a bit with the color schemes of the RBrewer package and editing the legend titles.  And I finally figured out how to delete the startup library load messages!
