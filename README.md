## Progress:

- For the README file:
    + I edited the file using RStudio
    + I am making this page using RStudio and will commit, pull and push to the Github Repo
    + So far, using RMarkdown has not been too challenging.  I am hoping to familiarize myself more with the syntax of the program.
  
Looking forward to the rest of the semester!  I do not have any experience in programming so each session seems to be very informative!
