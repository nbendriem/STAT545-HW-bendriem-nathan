# STAT545-hw02-Bendriem-Nathan

For this homework, I played around with the gapminder dataset and the ggplot functions.

There are several files within the hw02 folder.  The answers to HW02 files (.Rmd, .md, .html) show all of the answers to the questions, as well as the steps I took to get the answers, the code functions I relied on, and the numerous graphs I created

The R Codes for HW2 file is basically just a rough draft, trying to pinpoint down the correct code function.  I included it for my own benefit, in case I want to retrace my steps.  

## Progress on this Homework

This homework took much longer than the first one.  The hardest things to overcome were to pinpoint the right coding function, whether its "select", or "filter" or piping %>% 

In terms of the graphs, once the basic function was set, adding the aesthetics was not too hard.  I played around with the alpha, and I decided to focus on one color for all graphs, red. 

I have been relying on other students, discussing before and after class to see if we have similar problems and how we solved them.  

Last I decided to avoid the "I want to do more" section of the homework and focus on what is required and to make it as neat and organized and legible as possible.  I will attempt to go beyond on the following homeworks, as I get accustomed to RStudio more.
