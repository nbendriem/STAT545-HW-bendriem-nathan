## Read.Me

Welcome to the Homework 3 Folder!

Within the folder are the .md, .rmd, and the .html files with the assignment.  There is also a folder with all the plots and tables, which are also found within the markdown file.  

This homework took a bit more time than the first two, but it is becoming easier to work my way through the different ggplot types and the different coding functions that we have been learning in class

Nonetheless, I relied heavily on the class notes and the office hours offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays
